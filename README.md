## How I Achieved the Project Step-by-Step

1.  **Project Setup**: I created the required file structure: `index.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`, and `style.css`. I chose to use the Bootstrap CDN for quick setup as instructed.

2.  **Component Collection & Inspiration**: I reviewed the official Bootstrap 5 Examples. I was inspired by the `Navbar` from the "Navbar static" example, the `Hero` section from the "Heroes" example, and the `Card` layouts from the "Features" and "Album" examples. The goal was not to copy, but to understand the structure and remix these ideas.

3.  **Page Composition**:
    * **Navbar & Footer**: I built a single, responsive navbar and a simple footer to be used consistently across all three pages. I customized the branding and made sure the active link state worked correctly for each page.
    * **Home Page**: I designed a prominent hero section with a strong call-to-action. For the features section, I used a 3-column grid of Bootstrap cards, adding custom styling for hover effects and a more dynamic feel.
    * **About Page**: I used a two-column layout to present the company mission alongside an image. For the "Meet the Team" section, I again used cards, this time with images, to create a professional-looking team roster.
    * **Contact Page**: I implemented a standard contact form using Bootstrap's form controls. I placed it next to a list of contact details for a balanced layout on larger screens.

4.  **Styling & Final Touches**: In `style.css`, I imported the "Poppins" font for a modern look. I added custom styles for the hero section's background, created hover effects for cards to improve interactivity, and ensured consistent spacing and padding throughout the site using Bootstrap's utility classes.

5.  **Hosting & Submission**: The project was initialized as a Git repository, and the code was pushed to GitHub. The final step would be to deploy it using GitHub Pages or Netlify to generate a live URL.

## Use of AI Tools and External Resources

* **AI Assistant (Google Gemini)**: I used an AI assistant to generate the code based on my detailed prompts and design plan. It helped accelerate the creation of boilerplate HTML and the implementation of Bootstrap components according to my specifications.
* **Bootstrap Documentation**: The official Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples were my primary reference for component classes, grid system usage, and utility classes. I frequently consulted it to ensure I was using the framework correctly and efficiently.
* **Unsplash**: All images used in the project are from Unsplash, chosen to fit the modern, professional theme.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

* **Challenge**: Ensuring the hero section was both visually appealing and perfectly responsive across all devices.
* **Solution**: I used a combination of a `linear-gradient` overlay and a background image. By using Flexbox utilities (`d-flex`, `align-items-center`, `justify-content-center`) provided by Bootstrap, I could vertically and horizontally center the hero content easily, ensuring it looked great on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

* **Challenge**: Making the feature cards interactive without being distracting.
* **Solution**: I added a subtle `transform: translateY(-10px)` and a `box-shadow` on hover using custom CSS. This provides a clean "lift" effect that gives users visual feedback without complex animations.

## Learning Journey and Completion Process

This task was an excellent practical exercise in using a popular CSS framework. Instead of just copy-pasting, the requirement to "remix" forced me to think about how different components could work together harmoniously. I learned the importance of utility classes for rapid development and how to override Bootstrap's default styles cleanly for a custom look. The process reinforced my understanding of responsive design principles and the mobile-first approach.

**Total Time Taken for Completion**: Approximately **4 hours**.
